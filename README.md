80's synth themed TRIVIA GAME:

The following project involved the use of html5, css3, jquery
and bootstrap for astheatic and pleasant look to the website.

The aim of the following work was to create a Trivia Game that would allow
user to go through randomly generated set of questions with the use of an API.
To access the API go to: (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

The user has then 15 seconds to answer the question. Should he asnwer quicker, he will immidiately move to the next question. The setOut time of 3 seconds, and two seconds respectively have been set up to inform
user of his choice(right or wrong). If the question
was wrong, the correct answer will appear for the short duration of time before moving on to the next question.

After total of 10 questions the user will see the scoreboard with his results. He will be
informed of the total: correct, wrong and unanswered questions.

"Play again" button allows user to refresh the page, and navigate to the main page in order to play the game once again.

The main components or elements of the project are:

1. the timer (15 seconds)
2. the the progress bar i.e Question 1/10 etc
3. the question area (API generated questions)
4. the answer buttons dynamically created/appended with jquery.
   (Shuffle method was used to shuffle the array with buttons)
5. the answer area

Thank you for your time to play the game. Hope you enjoy it!
